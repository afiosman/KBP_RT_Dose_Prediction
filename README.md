# KBP-RT-Dose-Prediction-Models 
The purpose of this work is to compare four novel knowledge-based planning (KBP) algorithms using deep learning to predict three-dimensional (3D) dose distributions of head and neck plans using the same patientsâ€™ dataset and quantitative assessment metrics. 


# Availability of data and materials
The datasets can be found in the OpenKBP - 2020 AAPM Grand Challenge repository at https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/23428.
