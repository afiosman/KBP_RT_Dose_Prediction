# Varient-3D-UNets-for-radiotherapy-dose-prediction
We compared four novel knowledge-based planning (KBP) algorithms using deep learning to predict voxel-wise dose for the head and neck radiotherapy treatment plans using similar datasets and assessment metrics. The base of the four KBP models uses the 3D U-Net architecture. They include standard U-Net, attention U-Net, residual U-Net (Res U-Net), and attention Res U-Net.

# Availability of data and materials
The datasets can be found in the OpenKBP - 2020 AAPM Grand Challenge repository at https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/23428.
