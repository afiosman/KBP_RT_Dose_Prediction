# Varient-3D-UNets-for-RT-dose-prediction

We compared four novel knowledge-based planning (KBP) algorithms using deep learning to predict three-dimensional (3D) dose distributions of head and neck plans using the AAPM OpenKBP - 2020 Grand Challenge dataset. The base of the four KBP models is the 3D U-Net architecture and included: standard U-Net, attention U-Net, residual U-Net (Res U-Net), and attention Res U-Net.


# Availability of data and materials
The datasets can be found in the OpenKBP - 2020 AAPM Grand Challenge repository at https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/23428.
